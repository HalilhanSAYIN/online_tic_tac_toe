<p>
  This project allows you to play TicTacToe online with your opponent! After anonymously registering to the app, 
  you can either join an existing open game from the game list screen or create your own game from the create game screen. 
  While creating a game, you can customize the board by adjusting the color, choosing the symbols for player 1 and player 2, 
  and setting the board size. Once the game is created, you will be directed to the game screen, where you'll wait for 
  the second player to join. The game will start as soon as the second player joins.
